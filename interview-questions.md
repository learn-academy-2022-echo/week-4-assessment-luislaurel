# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: In Ruby a Float is a number that has a decimal, while a Integer is a whole number. An example of Float would be 3.3333 and a Integer would be 3. In order for us to get a Float value in Ruby we must  insert a decimal. So 10.00 / 5 would be 2.0 . this is a Float. 10 / 5 = 2 and this is a Integer. The simplest terms would be Float is a non whole number and an Integer is a whole number.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: From what I've gathered so far in my work with Ruby, it is just a way to return the value without using any keywords. An example would be

def implicit_return
 'This is a implicit return'
 end

p implicit_return

 I would still get my string, but I could have also used return before it. The outcome would be the same.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer:
Blocks are functions we pass into a method in order to get a value. The beginning keyword is do and ending is END. These are both needed. The different methods you will use within the function will need parameters that must be inside of pipes | | . For example an each method. 

num = [1,2,3]

num.each do |num|
 p num * 5
end

5. What is an instance variable in Ruby?


Your answer: An instance variable is how we create access to that variable from anywhere inside of our class, this means we can also access that var outside. But only if we that var trying to access it from outside was given access to that class. This also goes into the scope of it, they are locally scoped as they are only inside of our Object. The var would be given a symbol of @. Ex. @varname  .
